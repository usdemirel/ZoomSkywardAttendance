# ZoomSkywardAttendance

This project is created to help teachers to take attendance in a simpler way.

To make it work after getting the jar file, you need to create zoomreporter.properties file in the directory where you placed the jar file.

Inside you fill out the following information:
schoology.roster.file.path=C:\\Users\\....\\Downloads\\Class Roster for Teachers.csv
zoom.download.path=C:\\Users\\.....\\Downloads\\
webdriver.chrome.driver=C:\\Users\\..\\Downloads\\chromedriver.exe
zoom.link=https://domain.zoom.us/account/my/report
zoom.email=sdemirel@domain.org
zoom.password=password#putting the password here is NO SAFE.
skyward.link=https://skyward.iscorp.com/domain/Attendance/DailyAtte..

--Will provide more details later on. I have to take a break now..
